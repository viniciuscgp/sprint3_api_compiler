# COMPILER API
## This API is part of my post graduation MVP - Clean IDE 

The meaning if this API is to call an API to compile the code and return the result.
The main reason to make this API is to hide the keys and secrets from the frontend
making a type of proxy. It can be used to make an extra layer of compatility so
if we need to change the compiler in the furute no changes will be necessary in the
frontend.

## API used by my API
